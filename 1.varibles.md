# Varible in JavaScript

**var:**

- `var` declares a variable with function scope or global scope.
- It can be redeclared and reassigned, leading to potential issues like hoisting and accidental redeclaration.

Example:

```javascript
var x = 5;
if (true) {
  var x = 10;
  console.log(x); // Output: 10
}
console.log(x); // Output: 10
```

**let:**

- `let` declares a block-scoped variable that can be reassigned.
- It avoids hoisting and allows better control over variable scope.

Example:

```javascript
let y = 5;
if (true) {
  let y = 10;
  console.log(y); // Output: 10
}
console.log(y); // Output: 5
```

**const:**

- `const` declares a block-scoped constant variable that can't be reassigned.
- It's suitable for values that should not change during the program's execution.

Example:

```javascript
const z = 5;
// z = 10; // Error: Assignment to constant variable
console.log(z); // Output: 5
```
